POC GLOBAL COMMUNITY is a worldwide network bringing together individuals and groups who communicate using Push-to-Talk Over Cellular (PoC) technology via mobile devices and applications such as Zello, TeamSpeak, and similar platforms. The community serves as an open hub, connecting enthusiasts, professional users, and local communities across different countries.

Our primary mission is to create a unified, easy-to-access database of PoC communities, enabling members to discover and connect with like-minded users globally. By promoting collaboration, information sharing, and intercultural exchange, POC GLOBAL COMMUNITY supports safe, reliable, and real-time communication for all members. We welcome users from all backgrounds who value effective, mobile-based group communication.

POC GLOBAL COMMUNITY operates independently, unaffiliated with commercial brands or device vendors. We are dedicated to fostering a friendly environment, sharing best practices, and facilitating knowledge about PoC technologies for everyone interested in seamless mobile communications.
